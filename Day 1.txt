Java Buzzwords
================

S2 PORMA HI D2

Simple
Secure

Portable
ObjectOriented
Robust
Multithreading
Architecture Neutral


High Performance
Interpreted

Distributed (Remote Method Invocation programs can be written easily using Java)
Dynamic (Internet)/web applications can be easily developed using Java to access on network


WORA - Write Once Run Anywhere

platforms - software - operating systems - portable
Architecture Neutral - microprocessor (i3 -> i5 or i7)


Java Programs are Platform independent


Secure applications can be developed using java 

Java support OOPs 

- exchanging the information using objects in the programs
-	class
	object
	Encapsulation
	Abstraction
	Inheritance
  	polymorphism


Translators

-> Interpreter
-> Compiler

HIgh level code(ENglish code) to machine level code(0 's and 1 's) 

Interpreter will convert the code line by line
compiler will convert the all lines of code at once

java has both compiler and interpreter
